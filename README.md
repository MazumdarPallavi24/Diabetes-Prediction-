# Diabetes-Prediction
DESCRIPTION

Built Spark Machine Learning Pipeline and detected Diabetes Patients.
Diabetes is a condition that impairs the body’s ability to process blood glucose, otherwise known as
blood sugar. There are several types of diabetes, which have various treatments.
Without ongoing, careful management, diabetes can lead to a buildup of sugars in the blood, which can
increase the risk of dangerous complications, including stroke and heart disease.
Different kinds of diabetes can occur, and how people manage the condition depends on the type. Not all
forms of diabetes stem from a person being overweight or leading an inactive lifestyle. Some are present
from childhood.
The most common types of diabetes include type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes, which we cover in
more detail below. Less common types of diabetes include monogenic diabetes and cystic
fibrosis-related diabetes.

OBJECTIVE


A machine learning model that helps to predict weather an individual has
diabetes or not. The features used in building the model helps to accurately
predict whether a person is diabetic or not.


Somethings to know about the Data!

The data has been acquired from Kaggle.

This Dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive
and Kidney Sciences.

The dataset contains 8 clinical parameters as features with the target
variable being ‘Has diabetes’.
